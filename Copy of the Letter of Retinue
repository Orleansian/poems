To louers alle
Doyng yow wite the duk that folkis calle
Of Orlyaunce we him amytte and shall

And we haue him assignyd on oure rent
The fayrist pensonn aftir his entent
Forto enyoy bi oure lettir patent
While he good lust

As in oure part that we no thing dislust

In yowre entent
Wherfore we gyve strayt comaundement
To alle whiche ben as of oure parlement
then forto helpe and ayde in eche turnement

As ye ben glad oure plesure to obay
In forfetyng now herlyn what y say

Cursid daunger and wickid jelowse
And fals dissayt

[?]i trewe folk to hurt and to affayt                    
Of which that he is on in my consayt                            f.1v

To payne him silf for any greef or sore

For sewrte more he leuys in morgage

As we to hem god wot a thousand fold
Wherfore he shall not say he hath myssold
As his good will ar[s?]t forbede þat he shuld

But for ensample most abone
To cause yong folk to loue more sone
That causith as this him gardone

As in the castell of humbill desere
As for the tyme oure counsell holdyng here
