<D>isplesere thought wrath woo ne hevýnes                            f.14v
Nor turmet noon that kan to me abounde
Ne yet for dowte to dyen in distres
Power haue ye noon all haue ye me p(ri)sounde
Mi feithfull wille to shaunge in any stounde
That y haue tane to serue and evir shall
Thorugh which y thynke ther shall to me rebound
The gretist good that may to me bifalle

<F>or when so is ye greue me yet dowtles
Hope saith endure it forth and be iocund
Bihetyng me my lady and maystres
Shall witen of the woo me doth forwound
Not long to come gyf so y pursew round
All nys that payne but that y haue him all
But y truste wyn to make me hool and sound /
The grettist good that may to me ben falle

<M>e sparith hardilý do me yowre rewdenes
Shewe what ye kan y haue yow all pardonýd /
For sone y hope of comfort and gladnes
Syn shame hit were for trouthe me to confound
Thus wt no forse my care y cast to ground
Which ý endewre for my faýre lady small
\\waylyd//    But welle ben ~wayd~ haue y when is found
The grettist good that may to me ben fall
       
<T>hus am y he whos hurt in blak is gown̄id
Yet thorugh myn trouth good hope y to me calle
That in short tyme this shall be me gardown̄id                        f.15r
The grettist good that may to me ben falle
