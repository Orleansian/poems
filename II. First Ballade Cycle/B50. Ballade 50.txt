<B>i god of loue comaundid lo am ý
And bi the best and fayrist eek of fran̄ce
The castell of myn hert to fortify
Which clepid is the hold of gret plesaunce
Stoundyng vpon the roche of espeyraunce
And wt comfort so haue y him vitaylid
Ayens daunger and all his rude puysshaunce
Which y shall kepe to deth me hath assaylid

<I>n this castell ther are thre towris hýe
Of which the first berith propir name fyaunce
To have socoure and that right hastily
And the secund is callid remembraunce
The thridde is stedfast desyraunce
The wallis als so stronge are anbataylid
That ther nys wight may doon hit gret grevan̄ce
Which y shall kepe to deth me hath assaylid

<A>lthough daunger seche weyes full slylý
To rayne hit me and oft him doth avaunce
yet of his thought he fynde shall the contrarý                f.34v
Spite of his hatrede and his gret vengeaunce
Sith that good right is of myn allyaunce
For trouthe and he at nede me neuyr faylid
To brynge reskuse wherfore without dowtan̄ce
This shall y kepe to deth me hath assaylid

<L>ete vs make \\wache// wassayle withoutē deseyvaunce
And goo we assayle wt all oure ordenaunce
Daunger / myn hert which oft hath don vs waylid
And mars vs graunt to wynne hím bi sum chan̄ce
Which y shall kepe to deth me hath assaylíd
