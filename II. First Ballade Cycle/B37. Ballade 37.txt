<B>ut late agoo went y my hert to se
As of his fare to haue sum knowlechýng
I fond hím sett wt hope in compane
That to him seide these wordis comfortýng
O hert be glad for y good tidyng brynge
So now let se pluk vp thi lustyhed
For whi y make the feithfull trewe p(ro)mýs
That y thee kepe right swerely out of drede
The hool tresure of louýs gret ricches

<F>or this as trouthe to wite as do y thee                    f.26r
That the most fayrist borne or is lyvyng
She loueth thee of feithfull fantase
And wt good wille woll doon to thi likýng
In all to doon / that is to hir sittýng
And these wordis sent thee of goodlihed
That spite of daungere or his great rewdenes
She wol departe thee large maugre ther hed
The hool tresoure of louys gret ricches /

<F>or which my hert to say the trouthe parde
For ioy hath fett a thousand sithe likyng
And thow to weren blak were vsid he
Yet was it then y putt in forgetyng
And all his woo his payne and tyrmentyng
In trust to fynde it now or he be ded
Bothe plesere comfort and gladnes
And only in his gouernaūce to lede
The hool tresoure of louys gret ricches

<M>y sabill hert wt hope now blusshith reed
And for comfort of yow my fayre maystres
Which haue me promysid of yowre womanhed
The hool tresoure of louys gret ricches
