<M>yn hert hath sent abowt ye fer and nere
For his welwilleris frendis and allyes
As where for whi theradvise to here
To haue counsell of grete thingis which þt lyes
On hím as this bow he may his enemyes                         f.20r
As thought and woo wt ther cursid allyaunce
Best discomfit that moyan wold he lere
Which willith to distroy his ioyful chere
As in the prison of grevous displesaunce

<F>or in desert they putt haue his plesere
And ioye he holt of them but in patise
Saue comfort cometh to se hím ín a gere
And makith hím a maner of promýsse
Them to banýsshe lo in this maner wise
Hope hath him oft a chased disp(er)aunce
Which kepith ioy fro me as a straungere
That causith this my hert is rage martere
As in the prison̄ of grevous displesaunce

<O> myghti god y humbly thee requere
That y may se the tyme sone to arise
That eu(er)y man may to his desere
Without safecondit sech ther entirpríse
And then may loue if so he werken wise
Of daungere take but right a small doutaunce
Then would mȳ hert and y bothe laughe in fere
Which now in sighis doth him silf atere
As in the prison of grevous displesaunce

<S>yn absence thus me holt & from yow tíís
Mi hert complayneth that ye myght agrise
Hem forto here myn owen sovl suffisaunce
Me praying this to write yow lady dere
That he hath not all that he wolde desere                    f.20v
As in the prison̄ of grevous displesaunce
