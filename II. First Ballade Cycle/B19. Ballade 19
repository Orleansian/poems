<M>ost goodly yong o plesaunt debonaýre
Yowre sendyng which me gaf coman̄dem̄t
A balad forto make ye speke so fayre
That wt glad hert y shew here myn entent
Resceyvith hit as hit is to yow ment
Ye mow well se if ye lust to bihold
The greef that doth my swelty hert forrent
As bi the mowth y lever had yow told

<Y>owre goodlyhed hit doth me to repayre
To be yowre man in what god hath me lent
Desiryng most of alle lyvith undir ayre
Yow forto serue but what the gret turment
That y endewre syn that y am absent
And eek to writr me noyeth dowble fold
For gyf y myght bi othir wey or went
As bi the mowth y levyr had yow told

<S>uche is daungere my crewell aduersayre
That of long tyme hath me ín armes hent
In euery deede so fynde y hím coutrayre                  \\ [frowarde and contrayre] //
[For when y †paynd tha? she so laugh? ga?nt†]         \\That he ys l glad to se m[[e]] thys for schente//
More to reresse hit were but laboure spent
What greef y lede and haue of dayes old
Hit axith space wherfore if ye assent
As bi the mouth y levir had yow told

<G>o rewdisshe bel complayne my ponysshemēt                    f.15v
But welaway y wolde if that y shulde
For forgetyng to knowe my íugement
As bi the mowthe y leuyr had yow told
