<O> royall hope to long y se the slepe
Awake and in sum ioyous thought aríse/s\
And sum plesaunt remembraunce to kepe
Send to myn hert frp whom shall y devíse/s\
The fayrist borne as loos now gevith prise/s\ 
Hem to reioyse thou did but well in ded
For woo of weele hath raught hím þe fran̄chíses/s\
Wherefore alak now faylith him not at nede

\\plesser daunger hathe hym pot to wepe// <O>f [plesere daunger hath him onycrepe]
Syn that he now is fer in such a wise/s\
That he may not his worldly riches grepe
Which lady is of his hy entirprise/s\
O what hert hath suche destene as lyse/s\
In him o hope come socoure hím o spede
Thee now he hath thee callid more then twyse/s\
Wherefore alak now faylith hím not at nede

<F>or pouerte abeggyng muste he crepe
Where louers dwelle but what for /krost off peyes\
Nay for gladnes which fawte off foth hím drepe                    f.18r
So parte almes to poore that for hit cryes
O helpe lete not oure selynes arise/s\
Thenke on the poore and wt yowre almes fede
Without yo(wre) grace he ellis for sorow dýes
Wherfore alak now faylith him not at nede

<O> ye which bere the prays of all partise/s\
In whom all vertu hath a gret entryse/s\
Myn hert which hath sane yow noon oþ(er) crede
Helpe hím from helle brynge hím to paradise/s\
And now allak ne faylith him not at nede
