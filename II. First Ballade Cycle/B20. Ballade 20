<W>hen y last [[partid]] fro myn hertis swete
Whiche rewlith me in woo or hopis glad[e]
Whom isū saue and graunt hir sone to wete
As ioy of all her faith thoughtis sad
Whiche y lete bere the pouer hert y had
Away and neuyr sy syn of hit blynke
That nyght or day hit wondir doth me thynke
How y haue leyd this many yere agoo
Without an hert sechyng my pittis brynke
Hit nys but even̄ of loue myracle /noo

<W>ho ist may lyue or longe goon on his feet                        f.16r
Without an hert as y my lijf haue lad
Now certis noon that far ý yow bihet
In such turment as y haue ben bistad
But loue wold haue his power knowen or rad
Sum tyme in lengthe or sumtýme in a prynke
To cause good will in louers hertis synke
Hím forto trust what nede ye wordis moo
They mowe perceyue whiche tastid haue his drynke
Hit nys but even of loue mýracle l/noo

<W>han pite sawe how freely that lette
Myn hert bandon̄ mercý my lady rad
To rew me wreche al were \y/ no thing mette
And leue hir hert wt me syn myn y nad
So for myn owen me chargyng all and bad
Hit forto kepe which where y wake or wynke
So shall y do though tornys sesse or synke
That y thorugh daunger haue my crewell foo
But how y lyue and in such sorow swynke
Hit nys but even of loue myracle l/noo

<W>hat nede y more my papir spende or enke
Who hath assayde wot where to be /soo [oo]
For gyf y íuge who leffe in such a shenke
Hit nys but even of loue myracle /noo
