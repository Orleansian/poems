<O> stedfast trouthe displaye thi baner
Support my right y pray the hertily
And fresshe assayle this newe and strong fronter
Of thought and woo that this on whý
O welaway hathe holde felonshý
The litill ioy y had for prisonere
So that to me they make hím a straungere
I biseche god a curside mote they deý

<W>hen that y ought bere forth a gladsom chere
In placis straunge or ellis in company
Not kan y shewe but who seith a manere
For though my mouth out shewe a laughtir drý
Or speke a sportifull word yet verilý                                f.19r
Distres and daunger wt payne in fere
Abak they thristen my poore plesere
I biseche god a cursid mote they dý

<I>n cherte allas who had ther her
Or made of ioy me thynke so moche as ý
Wherefore of right as reson̄ doth me lere
yet at the lest y ought haue sum partý
But in baneshe as now thus doth he ly
Ferre fro myn hert as bi the false conspere
Of gery fortune and woo hir counselere
I biseche god a cursid mote they dý

<O>ut and y had as of hem the maystrý
As wolde god the terme that hit were ný
I shulde not mysse to brynge hem to ther bere
For Which alwey that this is my prayere
I biseche god a cursid mote they dý
