<A> brennyng desire to \see/ my fayre maystres
Hath newe assaylid the nakid pore loggyng
Of my faynt hert which drepith in distres
That in eche where withín his fyre brennýng
Hath he so sett that in a gret feryng
Stande y god wot left hit woll not ben queynt
Without thi grace o god of loue y crý
Helpe now myn hert þat many helpe hast sent
Thus calle y for yowre socure pitously

<I> haue asayd wt teeris of larges                            f.19v
This forto quenche but all to my felyng
The werse is hit this fyre hit will not cesse
Without ellis where y haue sum releuýng
I brenne y brenne o frendis come rennýng
And helpe alas this fyre were fro me rent
For if thorugh fawt in slouthe of yow y deý
Ye are in synne and blame to mýn entent
Thus calle ý for yowre socoure pitouslý

<B>ut what if so ý spille thorugh yor lacches
I yow biseche but this vnsely thyng
That eche of yow do synge for me a messe
And sone in paradíce haue ý trustýng
Among louers to se myn hert sittyng
As a gret seynt and martir for turment
Hath he hevene for his trouth and alone whí
For which as now in this grevous talent
Thus calle y for yowre socoure pitouslý

<W>hat nede y spende more enke or parchement
That fele the crampe of deth myn hert so nygħ
As thorugh this rageous fyre which hath me hent
Thus calle y for yowre socoure pitously
