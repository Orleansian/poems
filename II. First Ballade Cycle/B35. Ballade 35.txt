<W>ithín the tresoure haue y of my thought
A myrroure which y bought but late p(ar)de
Of god of loue as when forgete y nought
This yere a past which solde it of bounte
To me / wherín ay se y the bewte
Of hir that ought ben callid wel trewlý
The most fayrist bitwene thís and Europe
Gret good god wott hit doth me ín to to prýe
In abidyng my gladsom in good hope

<T>her nys likyng sett me so hye a loft
Nor which y ought to take in such cherte
For in the paynfull destene was me wrought
Fuloften tyme hit recomfortid me
That in myn hert nys ioy ín no degre
More then biholde how she is ín goodly
With gladsom eyen levtīg no poynt a slope
This is the bayte y bayte on wot ye whi

                    In abidyng

In abidyng my gladsom ín good hope                    f.25r

<M>e thenkith eche daý syn y my myrrour bought
As in hit to biholde where so y be
That euerý woo therwt is fro me b/r\ought
Wherfore in my good weele this am y he
Bitrouthis counsell and my fantase
Shall rolle it vp to kepe it more clenly
To oft soue that me lust as for hit grope
In tresoure of my thought to kepe it drye
In abidyng my gladsom ín good hope

<M>ore riche of weele was neuyr noon then ý
All though my good resemble vnto Iope
My myrroure hit shall riche me to y dy
In abidyng my gladsom ín good hope
