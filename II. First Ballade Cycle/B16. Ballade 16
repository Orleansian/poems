<M>adame ye ought well know to my semyng
What ioy that y haue had or yit plesan̄ce
In yowre seruíce for this wtout gabbyng
Togidere yet y neu(er) had puysshaunce
Oon only plesere to my suffisaunce
But even as sone as that y haue it raught
Daunger birevith hit me such is my chaunce
The small plesere that y haue to me kaught

<I> knowe no riches in this world beyng                             f.13v
Which may content to lessen my grevaunce
But it be what that haue ye well demýmg 
Mi verry ioy and sovl remembraunce
But daunger hath banysshid myn affyaunce
And me from yow that now y serue of naught
Which hath be tane out of my gou(er)naunce
The small plesere that y haue to me kaught

<N>ot hit as small forwhi hit suffisyng
Is vnto me in hauyng esp(er)aunce
Forto rescyue in aftir tyme comýng
Vnto my weele so gret an habundaunce
I trust it shall not fayle bi such penaunce
That y woll take for daunger threst abaft
Which woll enriche me lo well more þen fraūce
The small plesere that y haue to me cast

<O> fayre sum what vnto myn allegeaunce
As thynkith now hit doth me a turbaunce
When ye se týme hit ned yow not ben taft
Withouten yow to lede is displesaunce
The small plesere that y haue to me caft
