<W>hen y am leyd to slepe as for a stound                            
To haue my rest y kan in no manere
For all the nyght myn hert aredith round
As in the romaunce of plesaunt pancer
me praying so as him to hark and here
And y ne dar his loue disobay
In dowtyng so to do him displesere
This is my slepe y falle into decay

<I>n this book which he redde is write & bound
As akke dedis of my lady dere
Which doth myn hert in laughtr oft abound
When he hit rett or tellith the matere
Which gretly is to prayse without were
For y my silf delite it here mafay
Which if thei herde so wolde eche straungere
This is my slepe y falle into decay                                f.8v

<a>s with myn eyen a respit to be found
As for an howre y axe not for a yere
For which dispite welnygh he doth confonÌ„de
That they ne kan fulfille my desere
For which to rage and sighe as in a gere
he farith so that even as well y may
As make him stynt likke out a cole of fyre
This is my slepe y falle unto decay

<t>hus may y loo more souner wyn my bere
Then make my froward hert to me obay
For wt myn hurt he doth him silf achere
This is my slepe y falle as in decay
