<A> Daunger here y cast to thee my gloue
And thee appele o traytoure of treson̄
Tofore the hy and myghti god of loue
That shall of right do me of thee reson̄
On why[ch] doon me endewre gret heuýnes
That dost me dwelle thus from the good p(ri)ncesse
Which hath no pere such is hir happy chaunce
But what alway thou holdist thyn vsaunce
To greven suche as louys folkis be
For which y on of them most vnworthe
For them and me here take y this quarell
That carell to dye thou shalt hit not eschewe
As thorugh myn hond bi god so leue me well
Without so be thou yelde thee to ben trewe

<W>hi sittist thou so hye in pride aboue
That vsist this without occasion̄
to turment suche as trewe ben vnto loue
That wt hool hert and feithfull entencion̄
Serue loue without othir condicion̄
To moche to blame art thou / to blame ye certes
Wherfore bithynke thee thyn amendes dres
To leue thi wrath and hatfull gouernaunce
And wt lowe hert and humbill repentan̄ce
Go cry mercy to all folke he or she
That thou hast cawsid wayle or ben heue
To suche y mene as haue thee founde rebell
Ellis trust thou this that thou shalt not remew
But wt my gloue that y thee here appele
Without so be thou yelde thee to ben trewe

<A>lway thou thynkist yvill / yvill mote þ(o)u p(ro)ue
So full art thou of false suspecion̄
Well shewist thou bi thi deedis a\s/ thi move
Thi foster fadir was sum carle felon̄
What grevith thee though that wee haue in wone                f.31r
As forto loue to sett yowre bisýnes
To occupy yowre tyme of lustýnes
In placis full of ioy and gret plesaunce
Which is vertu and gracious deseraunce
Wherfore fals prowd cherle let see
Chaunge thi willis full of crewelte
Or traytoure y shall geue thee such batell
That hit shall do thee thi cursid deedis rewe
Well more than shall thi deth a thousand dele
Without so be thou yelde thee to ben trewe

<N>ow take my gloue or yelde thee wt myschaūnce
Let se coward if that thou dar avaunce
The toon of two thou chesen must to thee
Knokke on thi brest hit may noon othyir be
For nought
Thow shalt not seche no mo wayes newe
But thou shalt dye now speke on thi perell
Without so be thou yelde thee to ben trewe
