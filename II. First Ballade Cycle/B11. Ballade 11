<T>his fer from yow am y lady mastres                            
Savyng myn hert which left is wt yow ay
In company of woo and gret distres
I lyue and loke for comfort day bi day
Of plesere which absence holt vnder kay
That y ne may now stroke yowre sidis pleyn̄
For if y myght me fle wolde greef and peyn̄
And y shulde fynde so seith me esp[er]aunce
Bi purchase of my derkid eyen twayne
As moche of weele as y haue displesaunce

<I>f euyr wight as knew of heuýnes                                f.10v
Then gesse y wele that y haue made affaý
    As ferforth loo and of as gret larges
For whi of woo my peere not haue y say
yet not ne recche y †?† what y dewren may
In displesyng fals ielowsy certeyn̄
For y a port of ioy me do restrayn̄
And yet they spie how y lyue in penaunce
As an vnhappy day mote they atayne
As moche of weele as y haue displesaunce

<T>ake hit in gree o goodly yong princesse
Syn that ye knowe wherfore y am a way
Which aftir this shall turne vs bothe gladnes
Though that y wolde most fayne without nay
Ben wt yow swete but what y hit delay
And leue the joye y faynest wolde attayne
But yong and oold to serue and neur fayne
I shall yow loo and pray this in substaunce
that god yow graunt which power hath 7 mayn
As moche of weele as y haue displesaunce

<I> haue of woo so gret an aboundaunce
That teeris salt my hewe doth all forstayne
But sende me lord a lak and make me fayne
As moche of weele as y haue displesaunce
