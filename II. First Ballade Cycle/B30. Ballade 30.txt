<O> fayre y wot ye haue in remembraūce
Withoutē fayle this trust y in certayn̄

And aftir took it trouthe as knowith ye
Which shall accord yowre deedis boþe in fere

But gan to make full bisý ordenaunce

As by his lawe to bynde for wele or payn̄
Oure weelis twayne to stonde in more surete
As for oon weele wherfore as semeth me

And certis y enýoy his happy chaunce
To thynke his trouthe for which ý this agaýne

<W>hat y haue seid madame take hit in gree
For whi myn hert as for a more sewrete
