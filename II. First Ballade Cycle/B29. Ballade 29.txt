<N>ow drede y daungere nor yet noon of hís
Forwhi y haue a garnesshe þe fortres
Where myn hert hath rescevid the goodís
Of recomfort and passyng gret gladnes
Of which that trouthe hath tane þe gouernes
This place to kepe full sewrely out of drede
Daunger defye y and his gret rewdenes
For god of loue woll helpe me ín my nede

<F>or reson̄ noon but ín mý side ther nýs
And as for hope hath made me a promýs
To be my frend as he hath ben or this
That often has bi force of hís prowes                        f.21v
Made fro me flee bothe sorowe and dristres
Which oft so hath done daungere sorow lede
But not ne recche y of his heuynes
For god of loue woll helpe me in my nede

<W>herfore y the requere in all that ís
In me myn hert to take the hardnesse
And renne on daungere whiche þat fele grevís
Hath to vs doon for thenke thou neuyrles
But also sone as thou wolt take redres
A [y] wol hem yelde this is as trewe as crede
And y shall do my part without lacches
For god of loue woll helpe me ín my nede

<I>f so ye lust vs ayde goodly p(ri)ncesse
Sone trust y see the tyme so god me spede
To haue of blys a passyng dayre largesse
For god of loue woll helpe me in my nede
