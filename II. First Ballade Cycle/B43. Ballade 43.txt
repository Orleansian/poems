<M>y poore hert bicomen is hermyte
In hermytage of thoughtfull fantase
For false fortune so full of gret dispite
That many yere hath hatid hím and me
Hath newe allyed hir this may y se
To his gret hurt wt payne and heuýnes
And hath hím banysshid out of all gladnes
That where to dwelle nath he o bidyng place
\\wode//    Saue in the carfull end in payne to lý
Where he contentith bide his lyvis space
And yet y say hím how it is folý

<M>oche haue y spent of speche to his profite
But that to harke y trowe he is not he
Mi wordis alle nar worthi to hím a myte
His will is sett ín suche perplexite
That lightly loo hit kan not chaungid be
So is he gouernyd \al/ as bi distres
Which ganyst his profit doth neuyr cesse                f.30r
Him to avise such counsell ist he hase
That nyght and day hím holdíth companý
That he may not eschew his wrecchid case
And yet y say hím how it is folý

<T>his as for me y cast to leue hím quýt
Mi bestbilouyd myn hertis sovl lade
Without so be ye lust to hím write
Sum praty word of yowre benygne bounte
Forto alesse his gret aduersite
Ellis hath he made a feithfull trew p(ro)mýs
Forto renounce the ioy and gret ricches
Of gladsom thought or plesere in hím was
And aftir that vnto that howre he deý
The abite of discomfort on hím lace
And yet y say hím how it is foly

<O> fayre sance per lo this without yowre grace
For any thýng that y kan do trewlý
Mi dullid hert wol not comfort allas
And yet y say hím how it is folý
