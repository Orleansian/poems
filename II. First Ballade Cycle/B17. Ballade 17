<T>his ioyous tyme this fresshe ceson̄ of maý
When florra shewith of flowris abundaūce
That eche ennoý ought to ben layde awaý
And forto take all gladsum lo plesaunce
I fynde my silf withouten recoueraunce
Most out of waý oon ioy forto conquere                              f.14r
Eche thought and care so doth myn hert forfelle
That y haue well y may avaunte and swere
The contrarý of all my wrechid wille

<O> loue allas not se y lo this daý
Oon wight but that he hath sum suffisaunce
Saue y in loue which am o welawaý
The most woofull caytyf lo of fraunce
That faylid haue of all myn esperaunce
For when y gaf in all y had power
My silf only yowre seruíce to fulfille
I had not went haue founde bi no manere
The contrary of all my wrecchid wille

But what syn hit is this to that y daý
I bere shall as y kan my greet penaunce
Forth in my trouthe what may y bet\r/ saý
For in my trouthe is all myn affýaunce
Maugre daunger and all hir allyaunce
For ther nys greef that shall me do forbere
Though that disdayne thus evyr war me stille
She shall not cause me do this nave y fere
The contrary of all my wrecchid wille

<W>ithout comfort havyng in any where
Thus wayle y loo that myght as well be stille
For me so nygh is brought it may no nerre
The contrary of all my wrecchid wílle
