<A>nd god before the greef and gret ennoý
Shall hastily passe of my aduersite
Whom say y this saue yow swet hert onlý
And me woll falle a gladsum tyme lust
But wote ye loo as when that hit must be
hit shall be when the plesaunt lemys shýne
Of yowre most fresshe and ynly gret bewte
In at the wyndowes of my derkid eyen̄

Then woll the chambír of my thought trewlý                    f.31v
Of plesaunce take a light in eche parte
Such ioý woll hím aray so fresshe and hý
That waken must mȳ heuy hert slepe
Out of his fowle and sluggish slogarde
he shall no more then slepe bi seynt quýntýne
When that this light hath take on hím entre
In at the wyndowes of my derkid eyne

<A>llas when wol this tyme approchen mý
The ilke sonne to se y myght be so happe
But what ther nys but ye myn owen ladý
Must yow bithynke how hit may come to me
For wot ye well dere hert that y am he
In whom ther nys oon ioy forto ben sene
Vnto y may this likyng sonne see
In at the wyndowes of my derkid eyne

<T>hen shall myn hert hane of felícíte
As moche as any hert what so thay ben
When thís sonne doth shewe his gret clerte
In at the wyndowes of my derkid eýne
