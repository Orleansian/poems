<N>euyr more to loue oft haue y thought                            
So ouyrchargith me mu greef and payne
For ni this world was neuyr wight to wrouȝt
That euyr loue more grevid dar y sayne
But in the ende to say yow trouth agayne
For any greef that may be to me sent
I sewre yow bi god hit woll not be
For whi y kan not make him to consent
myn hert the whiche that maystir is of me

<T>hough ther be weyes many who þt sought
But what no force y ley them on þe playne
Thynkyng that sokoure shall me sett aloft
As in comfort or hope oon of the twayne
Allas if y had power to restrayne
hit shulde be doon y wis as sone as ment
Or sonner if ther myght be quantite
he shulde no more in loue be resident
Myn hert the which that maystir is of me

<f>or bi swetnes y wot that now and oft                            f.8r
Of prati hope loue fedith him certayne
That all his lyue to lyue so he ne rought
he lust not knowe that he me doth for payne
me drenchyng so in teeris sele that rayne
For \of/ plesaunce his wounde hit hath a tent
That nought he sett bi myn aduersite
But of my lijf thus holdith the iugement
myn hert the which that maystir is of me

<s>o many wordis loo as y haue soent
hit greuyth me but what hit more parde
me hurt that y haue geve \not/ geve but spent
myn hert the which that maystir is of me
