<A>t the short game of tablis forto plaý
Loue hath me long had in his gouernan̄ce
And evyr this he chargid me alway
Myn entir poynt to kepe hit in substaunce
And hath me sayd if so y haue puysshaynce
To kepe his poynt that then wtouten were
That at the last y shulde even verry clere
Wynne the game withouten more dowtan̄ce                    f.32r

<B>ut take am ý and y not entre maý
The poynt y wolde the more is my grevaunce
But ihū graunt me loo what may y saý
That y may onys attayne sum happe chaunce
To my purpos forwhi ellis of penaunce
Shall y haue more then evir had martere
Without so be y may to my desere
Wynne the game withoutē more dowtaunce

<F>ortune doth turne the dise so welawaý
That weele and woo me wayfith in balaunce
But what good hope he saith me thus mafaý
In whom y haue a full gret affayaunce
How that my trouthe shall gete me suffisaunce
Of happy cast vnto myn owen plesere
But as for that yet am y neuyr the nere
To wynne the game withoyuten more dowtaunce

<O> helpe me loue that sest mȳ atturbaunce
I the requere wt humbill obeyshaunce
Sum praty moyan that thou wolt me lere
How that y myght avoyde this iupart here
To wynne the game withoutē more dowtan̄ce
