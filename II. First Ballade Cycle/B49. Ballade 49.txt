<A>s in writyng y putt haue my wisshis
And that even in the depist of my thought
And yet got wot when all are made ther nys
But fewe of them that me prevaylen ought
Notwithstondyng for me y selle hem nought
For all the good that man me geven myght
In dowt therín ther were mysdemyng oft
Thorugh false conspire of sum vnhappy wight

<A>s neuyr more god helpe me so as wis
Kan myn hert cesse the woo which is hī wrouȝt
So richely portrayde as they lo that this
That alway so to muse yet he ne rought
Thus baytith he to he be so forfought
That even for shame he fayntith in his fight
And dredith sore left he were mysthought
Thorugh false conspire of sum vnhappy wight

<W>hen y am hushte hit mervayle to me is
To here myn hert how that he talkith soft
And so wt loue doth fester his woundis
Which newe and newe hath hurtis to hī brought
But what he saith he set him well aloft
And hím depart a thousand ioy light
But sore y drede left they be from hím rought            f.34r
Thorugh false conspire of sum vnhappy wight

<O> graunt me loue for whi full well thou ought
The ioy the which þou hast long to me ought
For well thou wost thou hast me comfort híght
Nought kan y say where þat thou haue me sought
Thorugh false conspíre of sum vnhappy whight
