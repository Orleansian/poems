<y>f y koude make my wanton wisshis flee
And the sighis that maken me so wan
Shulde y hem sende but what hit wol not be
ovyr the fomy wawis oxyan
To her hous / y seruaunt am and man
which y most loue of any creature
As only this my worldly lo gladnes
Which that y holde ín this poore lijf y dewre
As for my souereyn lady and maystres

<A>llas how is hit shall y hir neuyr see
o swete thought so say me if thou kan
hope hath bihight ye ye ye but he
To longe doth me endure the greef y han
And oft for sight when y come axe him whan
In sluggissh slepe y fynde hím be ye sure
Thus euery day renewith my distres
without comfort such is myn aventure
As for my souereyn̄ lady and maystres

<T>o lyue in pees y kan ín no degre                     f.27v
Fortune on me so pleyeth the tyran
But for a tyme y soft shall beren me
To that y haue to me more socoure tan
As thorugh my trouthe for syn y first bigan
Bi trouthe y trust do hím discomfiture
For fresshe plesaunce hath made me a fortresse
That me to loue ne lett shall his rigure
As for my souereyn ladý and maystres

<O> goo thou derke fordullid rude myture
And say for troughe forwhi hit is no lese
That y haue chose withouten departure
As for my souereyn̄ lady and maystres/
