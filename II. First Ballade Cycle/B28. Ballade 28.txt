\myn hert the schepe of freche tydyng/ <H>of[fa howe for in þe shappe of fressh ?? ladydȳn]
Hope hath a fresht wt lusty recomfort
To cary to the fayrist borne lyvyng
Which is myn hertis ladý amd cheef resort
And if he may attayne the ioyfull port
In self passage y mene to his desere
The see of fortune playn to his plesere
A ioly wynd als blowyng into fraunce
Where now abidyng is my sovl maystres
Which is the swete of all my remembraunce
And hool tresoure of my worldly gladnes

<N>ow certis y moche am to hír biholdýng
For whi y knowe bi verry trewe report
That ayenst daunger which of yvill willyng
Full longe on why hath doon me discomfort
That she hath tane thee hert as in support
To helpe in all she kan this out of were
Y stounde / for which y haue wt the fortres
Wherín thow doth kepe hís affýaunce
And hool tresoure of my worldly gladnes

<W>herfore to deth make cafull departyng
Bothe thow and y we wol off on a cort
To holde wt trouthe oire poore lyf lestýng                    f.21r
Ageyn disseyt and all his false assort
And often thís vnto oure gret comfort
Remembryng how be we ferre or nere
Forto a thanke aftir yowre rewde manere
Loue which hath sett vs in such a quenytaunce
Of oon so kynde and feithfull trewe pryncesse
Which hath bothe me and hert in gouernaunce
And hool tresoure of my worldly gladnes

<N>ow isū saue this shippe not for oon yere
But many one ageyn̄ the false conspere
Of suche as haue with daunger allyaunce
Whiche wolde of thefte and ther gret rewdenes
Birobbe me loo of all my goodly chaunce
And hool tresoure of my worldly gladnes
