<M>y wille my loue my very sorse of blis
As thynkith this what part y am certeyn̄
That neu(er) y forgete yow lo y wís
Wherfore y wolfe pray yow not disdeyn
Vnto the týme y see yow eft ageyn̄
That ye lust to bithynk him for a stound
The which that litill mercy yet hath found
In yow if so y durst it to yow sayne

<A>l be hit yet that y say not but thís
But that y ioý and wele do moche atayn̄
In yow swet company / for who there nýs
Hit to deserue in me this wote y playn̄                                f.13r
But neuertheles y wolde haue passyyng fayn̄
The reward which to trewe loue shuld habon̄de
Of which ther is all straungenes on the ground
In yow if so y durst it to yow sayn̄

<I> trewly serue yow as my power is
So oft y haue or ellis y serue in vayn̄
Such gift as loue doth vnto folkis his
Reward of grace forto a slake ther payn̄
Wherefore do as ye may content vs twayn̄
Acordith my desire o cum of round
To moche refuse y norisshid is and wound
In yow if so y durst it to yow sayn̄

<H>it is but coward drede yow doth restrayn̄
Were hit well doon for trouth me to confound
I nolde it happe shuld for a thousand pound
In yow if so y durst it to yow sayn̄
