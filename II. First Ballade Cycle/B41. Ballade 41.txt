<H>ope hath me now fresshe gladsum tidyng brouȝt
Which ought to doon me comfort & likyng
He saith that fortune hath hir newe bithought
And tath hir silf a bettir avisyng
Dorto amende ín euery maner thyng
That she hath doon me in displesere falle                f.28v
So that hir wheel shall take a new turnýng
But ihū graunt that hit may sone bifalle

<A>lthough hir greef haue welnygh deth me wrouȝt
I shall hit spare and put in forgetyng
All my quarell in which y felt vnsoft
My wrath also and all myn yvill willyng
Of eche wrong doon to graunt hir pardonyng
For y may fynde to serue hir loo and shall
If so hir lust to gyue me comfortyng
But ihū graunt that hit may sone bifalle

<I>f that of grace she sette me so aloft
And that to me she shewid so gret a thíng
That y myght wrappe withín mȳ armes soft
The fayrist born in liche to my menyng
For then had y as my desirs alle
Even verry hool without more wisshyng
But ihū graunt that hit may sone bifalle

<O> loue if that thou gaue a comaundyng
Vunto fortyune to lyft me of my fall
Of ioy y trust to haue a rekeneryng
But ihū graunt that hit may sone bifall
