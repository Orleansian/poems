<I>? loues paradise as them among
Not long to come mý hert shall haue aplace
And ellis a trouthe me thynkith he had wrong
Consideryng this the grevous gret a has
Not on or twayne they passe a thousand bras
In servyng of his fayre and swete mastres
Which daungere hath in hold alas alas
Only to spel me this in hevýnes

<A>nd so hath holde o welaway to longe
Mi poore hert this cursid trayter face
But what good hope as bit me comfort fonge
And saith he woll outplegge hím īn short space
But woo is me he spete so slow a pace
O ihū graunt he holde me his p(ro)mes
For sorow doth eche membir me arase
Only to spel me this in hevýnes                        f.18v

<O> loue gret almes myght thou vndírfonge
As to ben pitous on this sely case
For to alle suche it wolde example honge
That listith wel as in thi seruíce trace
When they parceyue how hit lust the of grace
So poore a sufferant aye of thyn humbles
Which on desert that deth doth this manace
Only to spel me this in hevýnes

<O> make me loue \so/ happe to purchase
Thou wotist what to sett me in gladnes
Or Antropos thou brest my lyvis lase
Only to spel me this in heuynes
