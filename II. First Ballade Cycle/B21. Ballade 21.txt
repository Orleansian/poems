<H>ounre and prays as mot to him habound
That first did fynde the wayes of writyng
For comfort gret ordeynyd he that stounde                        f.16v
To suche as haue of louys payne felyng
For when to speke they naue tyme nor metyng
To say ther ladies of ther aduersite
Yet doth it them a gret tranquyllite
Forto endite and sende as in writyng
What grevous lijf they lede as semeth me
Only for loue and feithfull trewe servýng

<W>ho so that write how he is wrapped & wounde
In suche greef as kan kepe hím from laughyng
And so may sende it to his lady round
Which is the leche to all his soore felyng
If then to rede hit be to her plesyng
She may right well therín perceyue and se
What woofull gouernaunce endewrith he
Of whiche pite may geue hir hit mevyng
That his desert is reward of mercý
Only for loue and feithfull trewe servýng

<T>hat hit is thus in myn hert haue y found
And knowe the craft for when he tath sekyng
No thyng kan hím appese vpon the ground
To he haue send or made sum endityng
On the fayre which is his most likyng
Of which if so that his fortune be
To haue a response of hir gret bounte
He tath therin so huge a reioysýng
That forget is he had on his partý
Only for loue and feithfull trewe servýng

                        But what

<B>ut what madame crist ewre me so that ye                    f.17r
May vnderstonde as bi my mouth telyng
What y haue dewrid in týmýs quantite
Only for loue and feithfull trewe servýng
