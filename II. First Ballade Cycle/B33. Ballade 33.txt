<M>yn hert if so that y good tidyng here
To telle hit thee what wolt þu geue me say

That faithfully she doth hir silf aquyte

<W>hat kanst thou say then of my lady dere

That she hath tane the see as yestirdaý
But saist thou trouthe or dost þou mokke & plaý

And saith hit is but thee forto visite
O loue as lo y thanke the humbly
That feithfully she doth hir silf aquyte

<W>hat myght she more for þee don wold y lere
Then put hir silf in such a payne and fraý
For trouthe hit is that strengthith my matere
Which causith hir so doon this is no naý
Then thenke thou this to loue hir wel alwaý
So shall y lo vnto that howre y dý

I would but say when y kisse swetely
That feithfully she doth hir silf aquyte
