<M>adame a trouthe not wot y what to say                            
Nor bi what ende that y shulde first bigyÌ„ne
The wofull lijf vnto yow to bwrat
which shertich me more nere than doth my skyn
hit forto speke as well lo may y blyn
for whi bi speche not kan y be the nerre
what helpe god wott as shulde y ni hit wiyn
Syn hit is so that y am from yow fare

<w>hat y now se hit noyeth me mafay
But y for drede my countenaunce forpeyne
As wt my mouth to shewe a laughtir gay
when that myn hert as wepith me wtinne
A martir me to calle hit were no synne
If Cupide make a seynt as of louer                                f.10r
For paynys thikke endewre y lo not thynne
Syn hit is so that y am from yow fer

<B>ut neuyrtheles y humbly thanke yow ay
\\hathe// For yowre writyng my woo ~hth~ pesid syn
With swete cofort y took the selven day
The whiche y more sett by then all my kyn
That neuyr fro my brest as shall hit twyn
Which chaungith not y pray yow as y dare
For now my blis on hit is to myssyn
Syn hit is so that y am from yow fare

<M>y ledy hert is lightid vnto tyn
Bi comfort loo but absence doth me war
That more y lust to wayle then laughe or gren
Syn hit is so that y am from yow fare
