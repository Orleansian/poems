<H>ow may he him diffende, þe pou(er) hert                        
Ageyn two eyen when they upon hī hight
Which nakid is wtouten cloth or shert
Where in plesere the eyen are armyd bright
As wepen noon kan helpe y yow bihight
So nygh they are of louys allyaunce
For ther nys wight may stond geȳn̄ þ(er) pusshaunce

<T>hen must he deye ir yekde him as cowert
For to gret shame is flight for any wight
Or manly to abide his grevous smert
To that a swowne he ouyrthrowe upright
And so ben yelde but what bihouyth fight
Bet is hit yelde him to thee gouernaunce
For ther nys wight may stond geȳn̄ þ(er) pusshaunce

<T>hat hit is this ye do right well aduert
mi lady dere to me yowre scomfitid knyght                            f.6v
For in good trouthe y myght it not astert
When ye the dart of loue vnto me pight
Thorugh out myn eye not knew y day nor night
So was y brought no wondir to vttraunce
For ther nys wight may stonde geyn þ(er) piusshaunce

<I>f that myn harme to yow p(re)uaylen

Which y haue tane as thorugh myn eye sight
For ther nys wight may stonde geyn̄ þ(er) pusshan̄ce
