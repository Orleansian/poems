<O> fayre madame yowre goodli lookis spare

For ihū out they harme and ye vnware

As my request lust not graunten me
In losyng of my gret aduersite
As lete me goon wt myn vnhappy chaunce
Without more assaut to passen fre
Which y haue for yowre plesaunt acqueyntan̄ce

<T>his wolde y swere but vnnethe lo y dare
That gretly wrongith loue towre crewelte
Syn that ye smote me wt the dart of kare
And me forto comfort ye lust not see
I trowe ye caste y shoulde a martir be
But wolde god to fele ye myght ben she
On of the stechis lest of my greuanunce
But fy allas hit were to gret pite
Which y haue for yowre plesaunt acqueyntan̄ce

<W>hat haue y doon offense that ye so are
Glad me to sle alak am y not he

To gyue me pese hit hurt yow not parde
Or graunt me ellis as my desire in feen
This woll be spoke yow shame no vallyaunce
That to my trouthe ye shewe no bounte
Which y haue for yowre plesaunt acqueyntan̄ce

<O> fayre madame now lefith this fantase
As graunt me pese or wt yowre grace avaunce
That y myght say o what felicite
Which y haue for yor plesaunt acqueyntan̄ce
