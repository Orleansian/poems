<G>ret perill is in hasty biholdyng                                
Such thynge as may encause a body dye
All kan it not ben had the eschewyng
Though hit be wrong right witt or foly
When plesaunce cometh vnto an hert lusty
A yong desire and fresshe wt hir bryngyng
To let his hert who hath ther then konnyng
But he woll sende þe sight out of Fraunchise
This comyn cometh hit is no straunge þing
As well to foolis as vnto folkis wise

<W>hiche eyen brynge of þat þei haye seyng
A report so gracious and goodly
Vnto the hert which gyvith his heryng
Therto which doth him loue so feruently
That he kan not eschew to sende him spy
Eft for sumwhat that mey be his likyng
Which byndith him for all his lijf beyng
hert and body to loue and his servise
This comyn cometh hit is no straunge þing
As well to foolis as vnto folkis wise

<W>hich causeith oft full paynfull abidyng                            f.6r
Or he may passe the gate of Iupardy
The tyme so long vnsewre the releuyng
As of comfort to fynden remedy
Which slepith of as in a nede trewly
For who to loue that geveth attendyng
A martir lijf he hath most resemblyng
Which greef is more then to be maddid twyse
This comyn cometh hit is no straunge thing
As well to foolis as vnto fokis wise

<O> god of loue ne takith displesyng
Though that y say as y haue knowlechyng
As of yowre bond the rage and gret Iuyse
This comyn cometh hit is no straunge thing
As wele to foolis as vnto folkis wise
