<N>ot long a goo y hyed me a pase                                
In secret wise myn hert forto counsayle
him silf forto withdrawe as for a space
Out of louys paȳfull thought and trauayle
To which he seid me nay sett there a nayle
Speke me no more therof y hertly pray
For god wot to loue y shall me payne
For y haue shose the fayrist that be may
As me reportid hath myn eyen twayne

<N>ow pardone me y seide as in this case
Forwhi y say hit for oure bothe avayle
With all the power that god well in me hase
That in good trouthe thou dost me to mervayle
Seest thou not well that fortune doth vs fayle
haft thou good lust to lyve in sorow nay
I wis he seid y trust more to attayne
I had a praty look yet yestirday
As me reportid hath myn eyen twayne

<A>llas seide y thou fonnust as haue y grace
That for oon look thi lijf lust to biwayle                            f.7v
For countenaunce or lookis of hir face
knowist thou hir thouȝt ye cast me lo a kayle
O pese quod he now good y lust not rayle
Now y bileve no word thou dost me say
For trewly serue y shall and nevir fayne
Of good which is the best leue this aray
As me repirtid hath myn eyen twayne

<O> ywis madame in this maner aray
myn hert and y thus haue ye brost atwayne
Byt what swete hert as gide us such a way
As me reportid hath myn eyen twayne
