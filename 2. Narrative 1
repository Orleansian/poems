<W>hen in myn hand was tan me þis patent                            f.2r
I seide my lord o verry god puysshaunt
Of pryncis prince o prince most excellent
For all the world is to yow obeyshaunt
I poore wretche bicomen yowre servaunt
Ay witt so dulle and y untaught
That y kan not thanke yow as y aught
Or to my witt my tunge kan not suffise
Twene ioy and woo my gost supposid is
As this to thynke and this oft to avis
My witt as now so renneth this and this
But as humbly y thanke yow lo y wis
As kan be thought in any maner hert
Or more if more that reson kan aduert
<O>f that as loo hit liketh yowre good grace
me to reward more then y am worth
For which that y while y haue lyvis space
[the?] sely will shall shewe to do trewly
yowre plesere sely will nay verily
ay grettist will shall be forto deserue
What ye haue doon not now but to y sterve
[eserue?] fy my speche hit squarith oft
For though y wolde allas hit may not be
Doth to take for hit suffisith nought
For of the deth ye haue revid me
That in me now as wys ther [?] parde
This may y not deseue in myn entent
But even the self[?] his ye haue me len
<T>hat ye have doon but ih[?] wis me so
That what y do mat be to yowre plesere
And if y evyr wilfully as loo                                    f.2v
yow do offence the seluen houre martere
mot y bicome y myghti god requere
For well y wott that kan me not bitide
Though that y lyuyd a thousand worldis wide
<W>herfore as this biseche y yow licence
aye forto graunt as of yowre nobill grace
To sewe aftir my childisshe ynnocense
As for myn hert an othir to purchase
Where as ye haue be take myn for a space
A space: ye for while y lijf endure
I gete it not ageyne this am y sure
<Y>it oon p[er]sone as noon hert doth suffise
What nede is hit to haue more than y nough
aye thynketh hit were an ungoodly gise
To hoker moker hertis wote ye how
I mene as this when they be gyve in you
And ye bitake a thousand on body
That on lust not depart fy nygardy
<A>las what shulde it to my lady greve
Though that y kepe her hert while they do myn
Bet were hit then suffir me myscheve
As for my trouthe this wot ye well and fyne
They not prevayle though y my silf forpyne
To hate for loue hit were to fowle a syn
my thynkith now in case as y am yn
<T>he god cupide as therwith lokid sad
And to me seide a hym what wanton hyt
I wende right well a tamyd ben thou had
But well y fele as now thou lakkitst witt
For this y woll thou knowe how that þe sitt                            f.3r
The forto like in what is my plesere
And where as that thou seidist to me here
<H>ow y a thousand hertis take to on
As forto kepe y gesse y do it well
Shuld she hir hert depart to euerichon
Nay sir let be right neuyr a dele
Take which she lust best wilt thou entirmelle
Lete hir leve the remenaunt me biside
And y shall well as for ther ese provide
<S>uche wordis leue hit is but foltisshenes
And go thi wey to purchase now let see
To wynne the hert of thi lady maystres
For as for thyn y take it hir bewte
And yit she lete it ly twene hir and me
As thou mayst se as yit she doth it wayfe
As she were loth more then hir owen resfayne
[B]ut and thou [ast?] hir othir wise conquere
I woll be glad to helpe the as y kan
Let se how that thou kanst thi servise bere
Remiembir the thou art a gentill man
After that s[c]ol so loke thou folow than
For thou shalt wite that ther be scolis thre
As in owyng not of oon degre
<F>or gentill must be wonne wt gentiles
Bi goodly speche and curteys countenaunce
The more that they ben sett as in novles
The more assure thee in thi gouernaunce
Tyme to speke and not payse in balaunce
For to nobles longith sewte of curteys speche
As he fynt tyme bi mouth or writyng seche                            f.3v
<T>he marchaunt wijf nay þe doughtr of burgeys
With giftis grete to fresshe them in a ray
So maist thou when ther fauoure best y gesse
But what a cherlis doughtir dawbid in clay
As strokis grete not type, nor tapp do way
The rewdisshe child so best lo shall be wynne
But loke who that most fowlist kan bigynne
<B>ut as for the thou must do othirwise
For y haue gyven thyn hert to othir place
Go forth thi wey sum goodly swete avise
So as thou kan to gete thi lady grace
For as for my y shall in euery case
As y haue seide the helpe in what y may
Now fare thou well y kan no bettir say
<A>nd so he him withdrew forto disport
And y myn eye to Bewte threw afer
And saw right well abowt hir stood a sort
That y god wot ne koude devise a wer
For gret disdayne and crewell lo daungere
They preysid [hir?] so nygh and round abowt
That what for drede not durste y in þat rowt.
Not for myn hed oo word vnto hir say
Lest that they wolde my mater ouyrthrowe
And well y thought if that myn hert so say
In suche a plite as myghty right well knowe
That to myn harme retourne hit wold [?] growe
For loue wolde that bewte shulde it kepe
And she was loth for pite was a slepe
<T>hen thought y me was best to make a bill
Bisechyng bewte of hir benygne grace                            f.4r
Mi poore hert that she not suffir spill
But forto kepe as for a tymys space
Vnto y may hir fauoure more purchase
For wold she graunt me to kepe it euyrmore
Then were y hool of many a greuous sore
<A>nd if she wolde more ferre of goodlihede
To leue me not as man without hert
But graunt me loo liche to a pynnys hed
Part of hiris to that my rewd desert
To graunt me more as may hir lo conuert
And as me thought in this that y no blame
Deserued lo for which to do the same
I me withdrewe and callid vnto me hope
Out of the prese unto an herber grene
As in my childisshe witt if y koude grope
Sum praty thing that myght hir plesere bene
But even liche as hit were a swarme of bene
So gan ther thoughtis to me multiply
To helpe me fynde id they koude remedy
Good hope as loo was no thing to seche
For penne and papir had he found anoon
A trouthe qd. he y here lakkith not but speche
And konnyng but allas they be my foon
O tewche qd. ho so as thou kanst do on
Forwhi good will hit may thi case preuayle
For which that y bigan all this trauayle
